# ZeroDivisionError only when a is exactly 0

This repository demonstrates a Python code snippet that produces a `ZeroDivisionError` only under a very specific condition. The error does not occur if `a` is a falsy value other than 0 (e.g., None, False, empty string). The error only occurs when `a` is numerically equal to 0.

The purpose of this example is to highlight a less common scenario where a `ZeroDivisionError` is not immediately apparent due to the specific condition.
